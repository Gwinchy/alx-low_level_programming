1. Introduction
Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves manipulating individual bits of data within binary numbers. It's crucial for tasks such as optimizing code, handling hardware interfaces, and working with data compression algorithms. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of bit manipulation operations and various number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.

2. Bitwise Operations
Bitwise AND (&)
Performs a logical AND operation between corresponding bits of two numbers. A bit is set to 1 only if both input bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|)
Performs a logical OR operation between corresponding bits of two numbers. A bit is set to 1 if at least one of the input bits is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^)
Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between corresponding bits of two numbers. A bit is set to 1 if exactly one of the input bits is 1.

Bitwise NOT (~)
Inverts each bit of a number. A 0 becomes 1, and a 1 becomes 0.

Left Shift (<<)
Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. Zeros are shifted in from the right.

Right Shift (>>)
Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. For unsigned values, zeros are shifted in from the left. For signed values, the behavior depends on the system.

3. Decimal to Binary Conversion
Converting a decimal number to binary involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and noting the remainders. Reverse the remainders to get the binary representation.

4. Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion
Converting a decimal number to hexadecimal is similar to binary conversion. Divide the decimal number by 16 and note the remainders. Convert the remainders to hexadecimal digits.

5. Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion
Group binary digits in sets of four, starting from the right. Convert each group to its corresponding hexadecimal digit.

6. Number Bases Summary
Binary (Base 2): Uses 0 and 1. Computers operate in binary and use bits as the basic unit of data.
Decimal (Base 10): The base we use daily, with digits 0-9. Each digit position represents a power of 10.
Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Each digit position represents a power of 16. Often used in programming for compact representation.
7. Conclusion
Understanding bit manipulation and number bases is essential for programming, especially in fields like system programming, data analysis, and cryptography. This guide provides a foundation to explore more advanced concepts and applications in the world of computer science.

Remember that practice is crucial in mastering these concepts. Experiment with code examples, perform conversions, and apply bitwise operations to gain a deeper understanding.
