What is debugging?
Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs in software code. When programming, it is common for errors or unexpected behaviors to occur in the code, and debugging is the essential process of finding, understanding, and fixing these problems. Debugging is crucial in the software development lifecycle as it helps ensure that the code functions correctly and meets its intended purpose.

Methods of debugging manually
There are several methods of manually debugging code, and experienced developers often use a combination of these techniques to track down and fix issues:

Print Statements: Inserting print statements in the code allows you to display the values of variables or messages at specific points during execution. By examining these outputs, you can gain insights into the state of the program and identify potential problems.

Code Review: Another effective manual debugging method is having another developer or team member review your code. Fresh eyes may spot errors or suggest alternative approaches that you might have missed.

Rubber Duck Debugging: This unconventional but surprisingly useful technique involves explaining your code and problem-solving process to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck). The act of verbalizing the code often helps you to identify the issues and arrive at solutions.

Binary Search Method: When dealing with large codebases or complex problems, you can use the binary search approach. Divide the code in half and test the two halves separately to determine which section contains the bug. Continue narrowing down the problematic area until you pinpoint the specific issue.

Code Instrumentation: By adding additional code to the program temporarily, you can log specific events or variable values during execution. This can provide valuable information about the program's flow and state.

How to read error messages
Error messages are generated by the compiler or the runtime environment and provide valuable information about what went wrong in the code. Learning to read error messages effectively can significantly speed up the debugging process:

Understand the Error Type: Error messages are often categorized by type, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, or logical errors. Understanding the type of error helps you narrow down the search for the bug.

Read the Error Message Carefully: Pay attention to the error message's content, including the line number where the error occurred and the specific error description. This information can point you to the problematic section of the code.

Check for Traces or Stack Traces: In the case of runtime errors, the error message might include a stack trace. The stack trace shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error, helping you trace the error's origin.

Search Online Resources: When faced with an unfamiliar error message, search for the exact error message or key parts of it online. Chances are someone else has encountered the same issue, and there might be helpful discussions or solutions available.

Inspect Surrounding Code: Sometimes, the actual bug might be in a different part of the code, and the error message is just a symptom. Look at the code around the reported error to spot potential issues.

Remember that debugging is a skill that improves with practice. As you gain experience, you'll become more proficient at identifying and fixing issues in your code, leading to more robust and reliable software. Happy debugging!
